In this task, I implemented two pixel sampling methods: neareast sampling and bilinear sampling. For neareast sampling, I sample nearby pixel's color and use the barycentric coordinates as weights to determine the color. For bilinear sampling, rather than simply taking the avergae of nearby locations, I weigh the colors of the nearby points with the distances between the point for determination and these points. To simplify the process, I applied linear interpolation on the two pairs of points, and then did another linear interpolation on the result of two pairs. Comparing to the neareastr sampling, bilinear sampling is more computationally expensive, but it provides a smoother transition of color among pixels.\n",

It is effective at removinng aliasing or any moire effects in the above said images. To implement level sampling, we first calculate the mipmap level at different parts of our image. Then, based on what method we are using we do things differently. For bilinear sampling, we take the two adjacent mipmap levels and then interpolate with the weighted sum. For nearest level sampling, we just round our level to the nearest integer and use whatever texture we get at that level."

Point sampling is the weakest among the threee, but requires the least amount of memory.\n",
